# Unlike everything else, gcc is built to be a cross-compiler, really.  It
# never runs on the target system, only the build system.  So it should not
# be using the proto area's headers or libraries.  Its own libraries will be
# built by the new compiler, and generally aren't using system headers anyway.
# This is not really completely true; for example, libstdc++, and this will
# need more work to be really right.  We only deliver the libraries.

# We could use the mpfr and gmp from the build system (since the compiler will
# be run here), but there's no good way to make gcc build itself correctly if
# we do.  There are two main problems:
#
# 1. Stage2 and later cc1 and company don't honour any combination of LDFLAGS,
# LDFLAGS_FOR_TARGET, BOOT_LDFLAGS, STAGE2_LDFLAGS, etc.  So the only ways to
# get these things built with -R/opt/local/lib are to use LD_OPTIONS which will
# yield the wrong results for libraries or to hack configure.
#
# 2. Even if we could get -R/opt/local/lib into these programs without building
# the libraries incorrectly, it would still be wrong.  The pkgsrc lib directory
# on many systems contains libgcc_s.so.1; however, cc1 was built by the stage2
# compiler and should find the libgcc that matches that compiler.  That happens
# to be the one we just built, not the pkgsrc one.
#
# So Instead we have mpfr and gmp built as part of the gcc build itself.
