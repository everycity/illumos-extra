Subject: [PATCH 3/3] curl should not set the library path for openssl

As part of curl's autoconfiguration shenanigans it ends up setting
LD_LIBRARY_PATH into our proto area! This is for future software which means it
is using our new libc which is definitely not the same as our old libc and thus
may misinterpret everything from the kernel.
