# Updating OpenSSH

Reconstitute the patches in the Patches/ directory into a git repo,
based on the tag in https://github.com/openssh/openssh that matches up
with that version. (Use git am for this)

Then you should be able to rebase onto a newer tag, merging as
needed.

The tarball in this directory is a clean checkout of the OpenSSH-portable
source without its configure script or any generated files. The
patches should only ever modify configure.ac and not configure, since
the Makefile here will regenerate configure using autoreconf.
